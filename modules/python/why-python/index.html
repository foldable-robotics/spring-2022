  <p>One thing I really like about python is that it is based on good programming practice . if you&rsquo;ve ever looked at python help tutorials online, you&rsquo;ll see the term &ldquo;pythonic&rdquo;. The Zen of python by Tim Peters is copied below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren&rsquo;t special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one&ndash; and preferably only one &ndash;obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&rsquo;re Dutch.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it&rsquo;s a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea &ndash; let&rsquo;s do more of those!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps many of the things I like about python are the things that make it different from other languages. one of the things I don&rsquo;t like about see or C plus plus is how every single line needs to have a semicolon at the end. python make the assumption that because there&rsquo;s a carriage return, that&rsquo;s the end of the statement. Singly, code blocks in Python are indicated by fewer or more tabs. If you are putting code inside a code block that goes in an if statement, see your cplusplus requires beginning and ending characters to indicate where the code black begins and ends. Tabs and spaces are simply window dressing to make the code more readable. Python, on the other hand, uses those window dressing characters as the logic. To me this saves time. Once you get used to it.</p>
<p>One of the more difficult things to learn when you&rsquo;re getting used to python is the fact that functions and classes can take variable numbers and types of inputs when you declare them the first time. The same function can take in a float or an int or another class just as easily; only when you start to use the data inside that variable do errors pop up. This implicit model for how variables are used within code has several results. First, it means that you don&rsquo;t have to think through your code before you write it. This can be good or bad. By not having to declare the type of the variable that you&rsquo;re using, it means that the same function or class can be useful in many different ways as your project involves, but it also means that the same function can break when using it with different variable types. often, this is much later than when you wrote the code first time, meaning that you&rsquo;re dead bugging something that you thought already worked much later. However, on the flip side, this means that you&rsquo;re able to write code that remains flexible for a very long time, even if you wrote it during the prototyping stage when you didn&rsquo;t exactly know what the structure or format of your final data structures would be. This permits rapid creation of code that remains fairly robust through its life. As I use Python for research purposes primarily and less in a production environment with clients or users who depend on reliability, I appreciate this flexibility and the relative long-life of the code that I write.</p>
<p>To me, one of the more controversial design decisions in Python works is that permits access to from wherever you are to wherever you want to look. There are very few restrictions on how to get data from other data types, classes, etc. This makes python very flexible, but for novices who don&rsquo;t know best practice, it permits the same type of mistakes that you see in other scripted languages. Structuring classes and the flow and exchange of data between classes and other object-oriented types has been one of the steepest learning Curves in my learning a python. However, in the words of Peter Parker&rsquo;s uncle, with great power comes great responsibility. python give you the power to make poor design decisions, and through the mistakes that you make while you&rsquo;re learning it, you learn best practice on the Fly. There are many resources out there on the web that will Guide you on <em>idiomatic python</em>, or best programming practices</p>
<p>another thing that python does really well is permit access to structured data at a higher level than other low level programming languages. Included in its base data types are things such as lists, two bulls, dictionaries. within it language and syntax are ways of entering data into those data types and extracting data from those data types much more efficiently than other languages that do not assume higher order data.</p>
<p>Just as functions put no restriction on what type of data is used within a variable, neither do higher order data types. unlike arrays in C or C plus plus, the data inside a list can be anything. You can have lists of integers, floats, classes, or a mix of all of those things. The same goes for tuples and dictionaries.</p>
<p>One of the things that I try to practice when I&rsquo;m writing python code is that my code should be legible without comments. Of course, this is a goal and never truly realized in practice, but I believe that many of the characteristics of python itself permit much more legible code. In terms of variable naming, there are a couple best practices which help identify what the object is that you&rsquo;re working with.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Functions methods and attributes should use lower case naming conventions with an underscore between words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classes should use camel case</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constants can be name blank variables or you can use all caps</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other best practices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Four spaces per indentation. Tab characters should not be used in Python code.  instead use four space characters to represent a tab. I don&rsquo;t know why, but this is most likely due to different conventions between operating systems and how tabs are used between them.  Good python editors will add spaces instead of tab characters when you hit the tab key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tabs and spaces shouldn&rsquo;t be mixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there should be blank lines separating important chunks of code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the other conventions that I don&rsquo;t like to follow is that code should be no more than 80 characters long. I don&rsquo;t follow this, typically because modern monitors are much larger and fit more text, making the size of the viewable windows that you see today much wider than when this rule was created</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>backsplashes, which permit you to run over a single line, can be used but shouldn&rsquo;t be used</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Python blends many of the best parts of a scripted language with the speed of compiled languages. Python can load dlls and modules written and compiled other languages, Meaning that you can separate low-level high-speed code from the organizational code surrounding it. I thought was very good for organizing your thoughts and for exchanging data between high-speed lower-level functions in classes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at why I like Python better than that loud Matlab. while both are supported languages, and both permit rapid creation of code, pythonic cells for a couple specific reasons.</p>
<h2 id="reason-1-free">Reason #1: Free</h2>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s free. This accessibility means that anyone can download and run it on almost any computer. the downside is that it is hard to install in operating systems like Windows.</p>
<p>The free nature of python does have some negative implications, many of which are getting better. while help is almost never free, python makes it easy to document your code, and the most highly-regarded code is also the most well-documented. In terms of obtaining distributions of code, modern Python has also built in a set of tools for installing and updating python packages from the pypi repository. this Functionality has grown with the transition from python 2 to 3, and some of the conventions imposed by the PIP tools are making things easier than they used to be.</p>
<p>While the python executable installer is not typically the problem, the problem is in many of the packages that need to be used on Windows machines. solve this problem, I have typically turned two distributions a python. Distributions are compiled sets of packages that are produced typically by a company, who then support their distributions for commercial applications with support and Consulting. There are three distributions that I&rsquo;ve used, the Anaconda distribution, a set of compiled packages produced by Christopher Gohlke, and the enthought python distribution.</p>
<h3 id="anaconda">Anaconda</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Anaconda for only a short time, but at this point it seems to be the easiest way to get python &ndash; and all the scientific package you need for it &ndash; installed on your computer regardless of operating system. Anaconda is a distribution of python with a installer and updater called &ldquo;conda&rdquo; which helps keep everything a bit better maintained than the alternatives(pip / pypi / gohlke / homebrew were my previous solutions, for windows and mac). It doesn&rsquo;t have everything, but it plays nice with installers like pip, for example, and gives you a lot of control over how you install your packages for different problems. It also allows you to install multiple versions of python in different environments, creating a nice sandbox to play in to keep projects small and self-contained.</p>
<p>I prefer to install miniconda and then create a custom environment for different projects. Install instructions can be found in the tutorials.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about Anaconda is that it ships with the IPython interpreter, which is the basis for the Jupyter notebook. Jupyter is a much more visual, interactive version of python, which permits web-based development(with all or many of the bells and whistles you have come to expect in other languages, like tab-completion), and rapid visualization of your results. One of the best things is that it permits the use of markdown cells within your code to produce highly-readable examples for, for example, books like this. We will be using Jupyter a lot.</p>
<h2 id="reason-2-licensing">Reason #2: Licensing</h2>
<p>Usability comes in many forms, and because I&rsquo;m a researcher And because I&rsquo;m a researcher, I am off and doing my work on the road or away from my desk. Matlab licensing strategies include some which mean that you have to be tied to the network you&rsquo;re using it on, making it infeasible to use on particular days of travel. Python has no such restrictions</p>
<h2 id="guis">GUIs</h2>
<p>Similarly there are many GUIs out there, but far and away my longstanding favorite is spyder. Spyder is included in the Anaconda distribution by default. This is one of the reasons why I have selected Anaconda over enthought&rsquo;s more recent distributions. spider Features and environment which would be familiar to Legacy Matlab users. A code window permits the entry of scripts or file based modules, while a command line window permits those scripts or files to be run or executed, and for the user to interact with the data that gets produced at the end. this back and forth between code writing and interacting is critical in the prototyping process that I use when constructing new Python code.</p>
<h2 id="reason-3-object-oriented-support">Reason #3: Object-oriented support</h2>
<p>One thing in the great Matlab vs. python debate is the ease with which you can create object-oriented code. Historically Matlab has encouraged scripting, forcing you to create a new file every time you want to write a new reusable function. Classes enforce a file naming convention when you want to use them. While classes are easier to create and use now in Matlab than they have been in the past, python puts no impediments in your way when trying to structure your code the way you want. Again, with the downside that novice python programmers often the wrong Structural decisions initially.</p>
<h2 id="more-reasons">More Reasons:</h2>
<p>Another admittedly small thing that I like about python is that it uses 0-based indexing versus 1-based indexing. For me, this has meant fewer times when I have to add or subtract 1 from an indexing variable, or have indexing errors.  Python&rsquo;s indexing works just as well in the forward direction as it doesn&rsquo;t reverse, meaning that I can start from any index and go to the end of a list or go to any point at the end of a list.</p>
