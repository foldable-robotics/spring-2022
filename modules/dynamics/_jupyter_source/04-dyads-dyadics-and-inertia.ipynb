    "## Dyads\n",
    "\n",
    "Dyads and dyadics are a difficult concept to understand, initially.  Dyads may be defined in a number of ways, but the way which makes most sense to me is that dyads are the vector-based mathematical representation for physical phenomena that contain coupled, multi-dimensional information.  An example of a physical system that contains multi-dimensional information is inertia.  Inertia describes the spatial distribution of mass throughout a rigid body, and this spatial distribution comes encoded in a structure in which mass is represented in two-vector pairs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, operating on a dyad from the left or the right produces a different answer.  if ${d}=(\\vec{v}_1,\\vec{v}_2)$, then $\\vec{v}_3\\cdot d=(\\vec{v}_3\\cdot \\vec{v}_1)\\vec{v}_2$.  The ordering of vectors in a dyad is fixed, meaning that $\\vec{v} \\cdot d \\neq d \\cdot \\vec{v}$.  Dyads may be multiplied by scalars, which are commutative.  Thus $3*(v1,v2) = (3v1,v2) = (v1,3v2)$ are all equivalent statements.  Thus, most often, scalar values are brought out of dyads so that only unit vectors are conatined within the dyad itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *pynamics*, the dyad class represents a two-vector collection.  Dot and cross product operations are supported between vectors and dyads.  A dyad class in *pynamics* may be constructed by supplying any two basis vectors."
