  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><em><strong>Foldable Robotics</strong></em> is a course organized around new types of robots being developed in research labs and industry across the country.  These devices are designed and built using layered, flat sheets of a wide variety of materials, and folded up to create both form and motion.  This class studies these devices from initial prototype and design through implementation and optimization, with a focus on application-specific projects which seek to solve problems of cost, parallelism, complexity, and time with a relatively fast and easy prototyping method.</p>
<p>This class allows students to delve deeper into the analytical problems associated with these devices, in topics such as design, manufacturing, dynamics &amp; simulation, optimization, kinematics &amp; motion, and stiffness analysis.</p>

## Peer Grading

Some aspects of the course will utilize student feedback during the grading process, including but not limited to peer evaluations of individual contributions to the project, as well as design review presentations.  Student feedback may be used as a direct grade or considered within the instructor's grade at the instructors' discretion.
-->
<h2 id="late-penalities">Late Penalities</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of this class, failing to turn in an assignment on time affects you and your classmates, as each concept builds on the last.  It is your responsibility to get in touch with the instructor regarding any questions before assignments are due.  Late submissions will lose one letter grade(10%) for every day they are late<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.  <strong>Any sumbission more than four days late will receive a zero.</strong>  Additionally, due to the nature of the submission process, <strong>late CATME assignments will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<p>All assignments must be submitted to Canvas by the date and time noted in Canvas.</p>
<!--
557 Projects must participate in the Innovation Showcase on Friday, April 27.  Individual attendance is not required, but team attendance is.  Students should coordinate with their team and instructor to ensure that their project can be operated or displayed for the entirety of Innovation Showcase.
-->
<h2 id="submitting-and-presenting-work">Submitting and Presenting work</h2>
<p>Assignment submissions must follow the &ldquo;Submission Best Practices&rdquo; document shared on Canvas.  It outlines the expectations for well written assignments, reports, and presentations.</p>
<p>Assigned homework will be submitted for grading several different ways.  This is always indicated in the <em>&ldquo;Submission&rdquo;</em> section of each assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be submitted for grading via Canvas.</li>
<li>Other work involving external tools (Google Surveys, CATME, etc) will be graded based on submitting to that external tool.</li>
<li>Some work will be presented in front of the class, and the grade derived from the presentation.</li>
<li>Other work will be compiled into the design notebook (in the form of a website or report) and graded priodically.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to pay close attention to each assignment&rsquo;s submission instructions, as each assignment indicates the method by which the work must be submitted for grading.  Failure to submit work in the manner asked for in each assignment will result in a zero.</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<h3 class="allowframebreaks" id="attendance--participation">Attendance &amp; Participation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attendance is <strong>required</strong>.  More than two absences result in -2% grade reduction per missed class.</li>
<li>Absences and Tardies are treated the same</li>
<li>Coordinate with fellow students to take notes if you are gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This class is structured so that it can only be successful with your attendance.  Classes will be interactive, and will require you to come with questions, answers, and ideas to discuss.  Students should notify me if they will miss class, although this does not excuse them from learning the concepts or turning in their assignments on time.</p>
<p>Missing more than <strong>two</strong> classes will result in noticeable penalties to students&rsquo; grade, in the form of -2% off the student&rsquo;s final grade per missed class over two.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Please coordinate with your fellow students to make sure someone takes notes during class if you will be unavoidably gone.</p>
<h3 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h3>
<p>Attendance and participation in class activities is an essential part of the learning process, and students are expected to attend class regularly. Some absences are, however, unavoidable. Excused absences for classes will be given without penalty to the grade in the case of (1) a university-sanctioned event; (2) religious holidays; (3) work performed in the line-of-duty according [SSM 201-18]; and (4) illness, quarantine or self-isolation related to illness as documented by a health professional.</p>
<p>Anticipated absences for university-sanctioned events, religious holidays, or line-of-duty activity should be communicated to the instructor by email at <a href="mailto://danaukes@asu.edu">danaukes@asu.edu</a>, at least 2 days before the expected absence.</p>
<p>Absences for illness, quarantine or self-isolation related to illness should be documented by a health professional and communicated to the instructor as soon as possible by email at <a href="mailto://danaukes@asu.edu">danaukes@asu.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Excused absences do not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. Faculty will provide accommodations that may include participation in classes remotely, access to recordings of class activities, and make-up work.</p>
<p>If there is a disagreement as to whether an absence should be accommodated, the instructor and student should contact the academic unit chair immediately for resolution.</p>
<!--We will coordinate on the first day of class to determine an appropriate way to submit assignments and projects.  They will be due before class on the day indicated; this process will likely be automated,  so late assignments will not be recorded(or automatically marked as late).  It will be your responsibility to submit late assignments to me *via email* as well.  The date and time the email was received will determine the number of late days.-->
<!--
Students are allowed **five** late days to submit individual assignments, to be used as they see fit.  There are no late days available for group assignments or projects.  It is the responsibility of students to keep track of the number of late days they have used.

<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="classroom-behavior">Classroom Behavior</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep all communication professional</li>
<li>Turn off all cell phones, pagers, and other personal devices when participating in class</li>
<li>Use your laptops for classroom activities, not email, chats, web browsing, or other non-class related activities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="professional-communication">Professional Communication</h3>
<p>Professional Communication in all forms is required.  This includes proper dress when attending class remotely and in-person.</p>
<h3 id="cell-phones-pagers-and-other-personal-devices">Cell phones, pagers, and other personal devices</h3>
<p>Cell phones, pagers, and other personal devices must be turned off during class to avoid causing distractions.  The use of recording devices is not permitted during class.<br>
Any violent or threatening conduct by a student in this class will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-laptops-in-class">Use of laptops in class</h3>
<p>Laptops are strongly suggested for this course.  You may use your laptop to take notes, during tutorial sessions, or when giving presentations.  Please do not use class time for emails, chats, web browsing, or other non-class related activities.</p>
<h2 id="reorganizing-a-team">Reorganizing a Team</h2>
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please try to work out any team-based issues.</li>
<li>Please see me if the team is not working.  I may choose to split the team</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>Reorganizing teams is not a desired outcome of a group project but is sometimes necessary if dysfunction rises to a level that it cannot complete the project.  One or more teammates or the instructor may initiate the process to split or reorganize a team.  Splitting teams does not necessarily work in any members&rsquo; best interests, as team-based Team Assignments, which each team member must contribute to, are afterwards spread across fewer people.</p>
<p>However, if the need arises, members must work with the professor to outline the issues which are creating the need to reorganize and the measures which remaining teammates may take to rectify the situation.  This can take the form of changes made to communication, workload reallocation, new meeting times, etc.  The professor will have the final say in establishing a set of expectations for the team, which must be met within a week.  If members fail to live up to these expectations, the team may be split and reorganized, as deemed necessary by the instructor.</p>
<p>When reorganiztion occurs, each new team will set up their own folders starting with the former team&rsquo;s work, but  new material will be created by the new team, and old material adapted based on the new direction of each new team.  Any changes to the project definition due to the split (such as project scope, performance specifications, timeline, etc) will need to be coordinated with the instructor for all future submissions or presentations.</p>
<h2 class="standout" id="heading"></h2>
<p><strong>The instructor has the final say in the establishment and reoganization of teams.</strong></p>
<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>This class is meant to teach you how to create and use your own design tools for creating folding robots using a variety of published resources, online resources, and classroom content.  I encourage you to plumb the depths of what&rsquo;s available; through this synthesis you might be able to create something unique.  However, I expect to be able to tell what is your work and what is someone else&rsquo;s.  For this reason, specific rules for this class are:</p>
<h3 id="specific-rules">Specific Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do your own work for individual assignments and tests.</li>
<li>Include the your sources of inspiration within assignments and projects.  This will help grow the list of cool references, but more importantly, help distinguish inspiration from wholesale plagarism.</li>
<li>Keep code/text/information you use from outside sources separate from your own original content (through the use of separate folders, for example).  Make it explicit what is yours and what is not.</li>
<li>Include all the licenses or copyright statements as required by the things you reuse.  This will make your own code more reuseable for yourself and potentially others in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students in this class must adhere to the university&rsquo;s academic integrity policy. Students are responsible for reviewing this policy and understanding each of the areas in which academic dishonesty can occur. In addition, all engineering students are expected to adhere to the University Honor Code. All academic integrity violations will be reported.</p>
<h2 id="recordings">Recordings</h2>
<p>Note that class sessions may be recorded, and recordings provided to enrolled students, instructors or instructional support personnel as deemed necessary by the course instructor. If you have concerns about being recorded, please contact the course instructor.</p>
<h2 id="copyright">Copyright</h2>
<p>All course content and materials, including lectures, are copyrighted materials and students may not share outside the class, upload to online websites not approved by the instructor, sell, or distribute course content or notes taken during the conduct of the course.</p>
<p>You must refrain from uploading to any course shell, discussion board, or website used by the course instructor or other course forum, material that is not the student&rsquo;s original work, unless the students first comply with all applicable copyright laws; faculty members reserve the right to delete materials on the grounds of suspected copyright infringement.</p>
<h2 id="notice">Notice</h2>
